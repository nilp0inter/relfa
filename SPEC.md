# **Relfa Specification**

---

## 1. Purpose and Motivation

**Relfa** is a personal digital assistant that helps users manage their semi-temporary files. It monitors a designated "Inbox" and gently reminds users to classify, archive, or delete items that linger too long. Relfa automatically moves such items to a delightfully dusty, cobwebby "Graveyard"â€”a structured archiveâ€”for long-term storage, so users maintain digital hygiene while never losing anything important.

Relfaâ€™s goal is to make forgotten files visible, encourage mindful classification, and provide a characterful experience reminiscent of a cluttered attic or spooky graveyard.

## 2. Key Concepts

- **Inbox**:  
  Local-only directory (default: `~/Inbox/`). Contains working files/folders awaiting organization.
- **Graveyard**:  
  The main archive, structured and quirky (default: `~/Graveyard/`). Items are organized chronologically and by host and event time.
- **Events**:  
  - **Created**: When a file/folder originally appeared (birth time if available).
  - **Modified**: Last time contents changed.
  - **Archived**: When Relfa moved it to the Graveyard.
- **Scope**:  
  Only top-level files and directories in Inbox are eligible for archival. Relfa treats directories atomically (no partial archiving).

## 3. Directory Layout

### 3.1 Inbox

```
~/Inbox/
  â”œâ”€ file1.pdf
  â”œâ”€ myfolder/
  â””â”€ readme.txt
```

### 3.2 Graveyard

```
~/Graveyard/
  â””â”€â”€ HOSTNAME/
      â”œâ”€â”€ created/
      â”‚    â””â”€â”€ YYYY/
      â”‚         â””â”€â”€ MM/
      â”‚              â””â”€â”€ DD/
      â”‚                   â””â”€â”€ <original_name>
      â”œâ”€â”€ modified/
      â”‚    â””â”€â”€ YYYY/MM/DD/<original_name> -> ../../../../created/YYYY/MM/DD/<original_name>
      â””â”€â”€ archived/
           â””â”€â”€ YYYY/MM/DD/<original_name> -> ../../../../created/YYYY/MM/DD/<original_name>
```
- All links (symlinks) in `modified/` and `archived/` point to the `created/` directory.

---

## 4. Behavior

### 4.1 Monitoring

- On user log-in or on demand, Relfa scans the Inbox.
- For each top-level item (file or directory):
  - If **untouched** (no mtime change, and for directories, no contained file mtime change) for more than N days (default: 14), notify user.
  - "Untouched" = the *most recent modification time* among the item or all its descendants.

### 4.2 Notifications

- Issue warning (CLI output and/or desktop notification):  
  `"Relfa: Some files in Inbox have gathered digital dust. Consider classifying or removing them!"`
- Optionally, provide a summary:  
  ```
  2 items in ~/Inbox have been untouched for over 14 days:
    - "notes.md" (last changed: 2024-06-10)
    - "old_project/" (last change inside: 2024-06-01)
  ```

### 4.3 Archival

- User chooses to archive via CLI command or interface (interactive confirmation, or write a script to automate on further delay).
- When archiving an eligible item:
  1. **Determine Timestamps**
     - **Created**: Use file/folder birth time (`btime`) if available, or fallback to earliest mtime.
     - **Modified**: Most recent modification time (file, or latest in dir tree).
     - **Archived**: Current time (when the move occurs).
  2. **Construct Archive Paths**  
     ```
     <Graveyard>/<HOSTNAME>/created/YYYY/MM/DD/<item>
     <Graveyard>/<HOSTNAME>/modified/YYYY/MM/DD/<item>  [symlink]
     <Graveyard>/<HOSTNAME>/archived/YYYY/MM/DD/<item>  [symlink]
     ```
  3. **Ensure Unique Names**
     - If a name collision occurs in any directory, append a suffix (`_1`, or UNIX timestamp).
  4. **Move Item**
     - Move the actual file/folder to the `created/` path.
     - Create symlinks in the `modified/` and `archived/` trees pointing to the file in `created/`.

### 4.4 Directory Timestamps

- Update parent directory mtimes (in the archive trees) to always reflect the latest child modification times, for accurate sorting and quick age queries.

---

## 5. Constraints & Notes

- **No partial archival**: Only top-level items, never files inside subdirectories.
- **Files are never deleted** unless user removes them from Inbox or Graveyard.
- **Symlink conflicts** are gracefully handled (by suffixing as above).
- **Everything is local**: Never uploads, never syncs by itself.
- **Handle Host Correctly**: Use only safe characters for HOSTNAME in paths (sanitize, or use a config-provided label if system hostname is unsuitable).
- **Configurable**: User should be able to specify:
  - Inbox location
  - Graveyard location
  - Age threshold in days
  - Notification preferences

---

## 6. CLI Interface

**Basic commands:**

- `relfa scan`  
  Scans Inbox and prints/delivers notifications for aged files.
- `relfa review`  
  Interactive review: list aged files, prompt to (archive/skip/delete).
- `relfa archive [--all | <item>]`  
  Archive all touched items or a specific file/folder.
- `relfa config`  
  Print current config and path info.

**Examples**
```
$ relfa scan
2 items in ~/Inbox are gathering dust...

$ relfa archive notes.md
Archived notes.md to the Graveyard ðŸª¦

$ relfa review
[1/2] Archive old_project/? (last moved: 6/1/24) [Y/n/d] _
```

## 7. Implementation Notes

- Written in Rust.
- Cross-platform, but only symlinks on platforms that support them.
- Should fail gracefully if permissions or symlinks are unavailable.
- Structure and messages should be whimsical, a bit spooky, but always respectful of data.

---

## 8. Sample Motivation (for README/UX)

> Like a digital grave digger, Relfa prowls your Inbox looking for files youâ€™ve forgotten. With gentle reminders and a bit of graveyard humor, it helps you decide what to classify, what to keep, what to bury safely. In Relfaâ€™s Graveyard, nothing is ever really lostâ€”just carefully entombed for future archaeologists (or nostalgic you).

---

## 9. Stretch/Optional Features

- Per-item notes or "epitaphs" on archived files (user can add a short message at archive time).
- ASCII-art tombstones/banners.
- Graveyard search: `relfa find <term>`.
- Undo action for the most recent archive.

---

## 10. Success Criteria

- Must not lose, overwrite, or corrupt any user data.
- Must never archive erroneously (should always be a clear user action per item).
- Should perform well with hundreds of files/folders.
- Should be clear, comfortable, and lightly spooky in its output and organization.
